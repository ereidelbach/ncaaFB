# SP+ Rankings

Originally created by ESPN's Bill Connelly in 2008, the SP+ rating system is a metric used to rank all 130 FBS teams. As defined by the man himself:

> [SP+](https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/27466530/preseason-sp+-rankings-alabama-tops-clemson) is "a tempo- and opponent-adjusted measure of college football efficiency."

As Bill goes onto say, SP+ is not predictive or forward-facing but is instead: 
>"... a measure of the most sustainable and predictable aspects of football. If you're lucky or unimpressive in a win, your rating will probably fall. If you're strong and unlucky in a loss, it will probably rise."

A further breakdown on the SP+ system can be found on [Football Outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/ncaa/2018), where Bill previously worked and developed the S&P system.
